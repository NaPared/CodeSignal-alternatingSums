#Several people are standing in a row and need to be divided into two teams. The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1 again, the fourth into team 2, and so on. You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people.
#Return an array of two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.

    result1 = 0

    #for loop separates the original list index by even and odd
    #then sums the arrays and appends the results to result array
